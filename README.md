<h1 align="center"> Joshvir Singh</h1>
<h3 align="left">With a strong engineering foundation ranging from a Diploma in Mechanical Engineering to advanced Computer Science, I bring a unique, analytical perspective to software development.

I'm Computer Engineering student at Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology with a strong focus on Data Structures, Web Development, and Cybersecurity. I am result-oriented and committed to continuous learning through hackathons and competitive programming.

My technical toolkit includes C++, Java, Python, HTML/CSS/JS, and SQL. Additionally, I am actively expanding my knowledge in Ethical Hacking and Network Defense, backed by certifications from Cisco and a job simulation at JP Morgan Chase & Co.
